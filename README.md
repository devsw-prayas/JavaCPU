# 🧠 Gate-Level Java CPU Simulator

This project is what happens when a software engineer looks at a CPU and says,  
*"What if I built this… but entirely out of Java objects?"*

Welcome to a digital playground where **boolean signals are wires**,  
**gates are logic atoms**, and the endgame is a **128-bit SIMD x86-style CPU**  
— built **one flip-flop at a time**.

---

## 🧱 What's Inside?

- **Signals** that toggle, flip, and carry truth like electrons with opinions.
- **Primitive gates** — AND, OR, XOR, NOT, NAND — all the classics, implemented from scratch.
- **Combinational gates** — neatly composed Lego bricks like Half Adders and MUXes.
- **Sequential logic** — coming soon: time-aware beasts like counters and flip-flops.
- **GateTester** — for when you need to prove to yourself that 0 + 1 really is 1.

## 🧩 Why?

Because abstractions are for mortals.  
This is **CPU design with no safety net** — no libraries, no shortcuts, just logic.

## 🛣 The Long Road Ahead

- Start with tiny gates and wires.  
- Climb through adders, multiplexers, and shifters.  
- Reach a basic scalar CPU core.  
- Eventually summon a **128-bit SIMD engine** that speaks fluent x86-ish.  

All in Java. All yours.

## 💡 Who’s This For?

- You, if you ever stared at a NAND gate and thought: *“You and I could build something real.”*
- Also you, if you're into building CPUs from scratch for fun. Or revenge.
